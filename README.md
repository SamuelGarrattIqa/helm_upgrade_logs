# Helm Upgrade Logs

Idea is to show logs of pods and events while doing a kubernetes helm install or upgrade.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'helm_upgrade_logs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install helm_upgrade_logs

## Usage

Still not working in a proper sense of a gem but the following kinda works if you want to install a release called `nginx` from the chart `bitnami/nginx`.

```
curl -s https://gitlab.com/samuel-garratt/helm_upgrade_logs/-/raw/master/bin/helm_upgrade_logs.sh | bash -s -- --install nginx bitnami/nginx
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
